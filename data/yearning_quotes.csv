I miss him in the weeping of the rain; I want him at the shrinking of the tide; The old snows melt from every mountain-side, And last year’s leaves are smoke in every lane; But last year’s bitter loving must remain Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide. There are a hundred places where I fear To go,—so with his memory they brim. And entering with relief some quiet place Where never fell his foot or shone his face I say, “There is no memory of him here!” And so stand stricken, so remembering him.",Edna St. Vincent Millay,yearning

I watch her drink in the sight, sensing the flood of memories she's unleashed and wanting nothing more than to let her know I'm here. But instead I stay where I am and stare up at the moon as well.

"Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and being alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You have to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes too near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself that you tasted as many as you could.",Louise Erdrich,yearning

"The weight of the world is love. Under the burden of solitude, under the burden of dissatisfaction the weight, the weight we carry is love. Who can deny? In dreams it touches the body, in thought constructs a miracle, in imagination anguishes till born in human— looks out of the heart burning with purity— for the burden of life is love, but we carry the weight wearily, and so must rest in the arms of love at last, must rest in the arms of love. No rest without love, no sleep without dreams of love— be mad or chill obsessed with angels or machines, the final wish is love —cannot be bitter, cannot deny, cannot withhold if denied: the weight is too heavy —must give for no return as thought is given in solitude in all the excellence of its excess. The warm bodies shine together in the darkness, the hand moves to the center of the flesh, the skin trembles in happiness and the soul comes joyful to the eye— yes, yes, that's what I wanted, I always wanted, I always wanted, to return to the body where I was born.",Allen Ginsberg,yearning
"MOTHER IS WATER I wish I could Shower your head with flowers And anoint your feet with my tears, For I know I have caused you So much heartache, frustration and despair – Throughout my youthful years. I wish I could give you The remainder of my life To add to yours, Or simply erase The lines on your face, And mend all that has been torn. For next to God, You are the fire That has given light To the flame in each of my eyes. You are the fountain That nourished my growth, And from your chalice – Gave me life. Without the wetness of your love, The fragrance of your water, Or the trickling sounds of Your voice, I shall always feel thirsty.",Suzy Kassem,yearning

"A Pause of Thought I looked for that which is not, nor can be, And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth But years must pass before a hope of youth Is resigned utterly. I watched and waited with a steadfast will: And though the object seemed to flee away That I so longed for, ever day by day I watched and waited still. Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more; My expectation wearies and shall cease; I will resign it now and be at peace: Yet never gave it o'er. Sometimes I said: It is an empty name I long for; to a name why should I give The peace of all the days I have to live?-- Yet gave it all the same. Alas, thou foolish one! alike unfit For healthy joy and salutary pain: Thou knowest the chase useless, and again Turnest to follow it.",Christina Rossetti,yearning

It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared. Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star.

Send me word that he has come back.",Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,yearning

"My greatest weakness has always been my desire for love. It is a yawning chasm within me, and the more than I reach for it, the more easily I am tricked. I am a walking bruise, an open sore.

"You can’t solve everything with philosophical quotes and mouse clicks.

Some never met again but carried the ghost of a person forever: love.",Narik N.Q.,yearning

If we try to take it out, there’s a good chance you’ll bleed out before we can stitch you back up. So, it’s either we kill you trying… or you live with it for the rest of your life.

I was pretending that I didn't notice that I'd constructed a whole hope for whatever was finally happening to me, but that there I was wearing glasses with the open book, as if I loved so much that I could only shout ""no"".

"Alexa emits a sad but fond chuckle and once again reaches over to gently slip her hand into mine, When she lets go, I can't help but wish she didn't.",Carli J. Corson,yearning
"The truth was she could not find it in her to love me. And with good reason. Never in my life has anyone loved me, ever. In any case, women were mysterious creatures. Passing my mind over all the women I had known or observed, I was driven to conclude that true love was beyond them. When they were in a position to love, they did not. Instead, they ached for the unattainable — the opportunities missed, the salve that their broken hearts longed for — thereby mistaking their yearning for love.",Sabahattin Ali,yearning
"Might have stayed': the emptiest tense of all, not just past but conditional, the breeding ground of yearning and regret and counter-factual speculation.",Edward St. Aubyn,yearning
"Well sometimes what I want feels so grandiose: to have somebody's name imprinted on my tongue with how often I speak it, to twist our lives round one another and grow upwards together, our stems stronger. To have to fight through someone to this world with. And sometimes it feels quiet. I just want a hand to hold, a shoulder to lean on, I want to feel at rest with someone.",Bea Fitzgerald,yearning

The far-away headlights of cars crossing bridges, watched from the windows of dreary hotels on clear, moonlit nights. Candlelight and lanterns, the lights of small shops in ancient, forgotten alleys, the lights of ships sailing to places I will never see, lamp-post lights on dark, rainy winter nights, solitary lighthouses and the lights of unknown fishermen, the glittering lights I saw in the eyes of kind strangers in cities tourists never visit. All these lights I once loved now break me; they remind me of the magical light that was extinguished in your eyes…",Louis Yako,yearning
"I think of my mom and Nina... how their dream was acting and it never came true. I wonder what one day my failed dream might be. I wonder what it's like being in a talent show, your mom in the audience clapping for you.",Holly Wilson,yearning
