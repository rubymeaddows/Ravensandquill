"It always makes me a little sad when you laugh,"" Julian went on. ""The way it sort of takes you by surprise. I love it, it has that sweet sincerity that's the best part of you, but it still kills me how you never seem to expect it. All I want to do is make you happy, and you're the unhappiest person I've ever met.",Micah Nemerever,dark-academia
"I hope you looked west while I was looking east, and that for a moment you met my eyes without knowing it. I know you never look away, ever when your eyes are closed, but I'm never certain you can see what's really there. I miss you to pieces. Yours Always - J",Micah Nemerever,dark-academia
"I always think of a passage from the Symposium, this allegory about people who started off as two halves of a whole, but then something cut them apart, and they spend their whole lives looking for their other half so they can fit themselves back together. And that's how it feels, it hurts, it's like I lost you before I was born.",Micah Nemerever,dark-academia
The question isn't whether magic is real. It's whether I can touch it without being consumed by it.,Victoria  Lee,dark-academia
"A human life is a beautiful thing,"" he said. ""You humans.... you feel. You feel so deeply that it consumes you. There were humans I kept a watch over, though I would blink and they'd be fifty, sixty years older—and the time would come for me to meet them. For the longest time, I pitied them for their short lives. And I admit, Signa, that I have grown more callous with my age. But I have also grown to admire humans. They've such a short time to experience their lives, and so they must feel deeply. They must experience in one life-time things it's taken me an eternity to experience. When I see men like Elijah, rather than feel guilt for what I've done, I remember that he feels sorrow because he loved so deeply. And were I not real, Little Bird, were I not Death, he would never have experienced that love. So which is better? To live forever, or to live and love?",Adalyn  Grace,dark-academia

"You are not cursed-you are a reaper. You are the night incarnate, the ferrier of souls. You are the bridge between the living and the dead—a caged bird that's ready to fly.

"I still feel ghosts around me: the ghosts of the five Dalloway girls who defied the boxes and coffins the world tried to put them in. The ghosts of other women who attended or worked at this school, but whose legacies were forgotten instead of deified. The ghosts of every girl who came here and felt history beneath her feet. But I'm not haunted anymore. Maybe I never was.",Victoria  Lee,dark-academia

"What defines a romance? All scholars seem to converge on a single point: it is a story that must have a happy ending. And why is that? I say, it is because a romance is a belief in the impossible: that anything ends happily. For the only true end is death - and in this way, is romance not a rebuke of mortality? When love is here, I am not. When love is not, I am gone. Perhaps a romance is a story with no end at all; where the end is but a wardrobe with a false back, leading to stranger and more merciful words. From an epistemological theory of romance by Dr. Edmund Huber, collected in the Llyrian Journal of Literary Criticism, 199 AD",Ava Reid,dark-academia

"It was just us - the seven of us and the trees and the sky and the lake and the moon and, of course, Shakespeare.

"Xaroth rubbed his snout as smoke flew out his nostrils. “Let me tell you this, Moonberry.” He intoned, in a voice that made my blood run cold. “The path I tread is one paved with the bones of those who dared defy me. Each scar on my scales is a testament to the countless souls who have fallen before me, crushed under the weight of my wrath.” He paused, his eyes narrowing into slits, a cruel smile playing on his lips. “You may see me as a tyrant, a creature of unrelenting pride, but know this: my actions are driven by a relentless pursuit of power. They are the manifestations of a soul that revels in the destruction and despair I leave in my wake.” Xaroth leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a chilling whisper, each word laced with malice. “I have watched kingdoms burn, their glories turned to ashes. I have seen comrades, bound by honor and duty, fall in the heat of battle, their dying screams a symphony to my ears. The thrill of victory is a heady intoxication, one that fuels the darkness within me.",Tiano Mattherson,dark-academia
"Xaroth strode out as the bell rang, blood on his hands. “Tell me why the hell you skipped school?” he growled, eyes burning with anger. Orion shook his head in shame.

"De waarde van haar leven lag in de verbinding met hen van wie ze hield en in de woorden die onuitgesproken bleven omdat één blik genoeg was.

"I don’t know…What do men call their girlfriends? Sugar?” I regret it the second I say it, but Alex raises an eyebrow before I can retract my statement. “Sugar. You want to be called sugar.” “No, not sugar. Something else, like…” I scratch my head. I have no idea. He presses his lips together. “Sugar.” I shove him out of the way, feeling my cheeks flame. “Not sugar. Honey? No. Not honey. Muffin? No.” He looks exasperated with me. “Jesus Christ. What’s next? Eggs? Preheat oven to two fifty?Baking soda, I’m home!",Autumn Woods,dark-academia
"Despite what the SIS:TUM implies, not everything is a business. Not everything is for sale.

"You know that I am one of the foremost living experts on the ways of the Folk,"" I said. I was not worried about bragging, for this was a simple statement of fact. ""That is the problem,"" Lilja replied. ""Yes, I know that you know the Folk, but there is a difference between knowing and feeling. Those of us who live among them would never trust the tall ones. For all you have read about and studied the Folk, you have never truly lived with them, dear. They are like--- like nature. Can you understand the feeling of a winter night, or a spring wind, if you have only read about it?"" This was an uncomfortable echo of something Farris had said to me once. I pursed my lips and replied, ""All right. Let us accept for the sake of argument that you possess a truer understanding of the Folk than I, that books and academic knowledge are secondary to lived experience. What then would you have me fear?"" She hesitated. ""Power,"" she said at last. ""In our stories, it is the great ones--- the lords and ladies, the monarchs and generals, that one must avoid above all else. They are the true monsters lurking in the night."" This again! I thought. Aloud I said, ""I have heard a similar opinion recently from another friend of mine, who seems to think Wendell will abandon me to die of exposure or some such, I suppose when he becomes tired of me."" ""Oh, no!"" Lilja said. ""That is not what I meant--- I don't believe for a second that Wendell would harm you. But I worry there will come a day when you no longer recognize him. And what hurt is worse than that?",Heather Fawcett,dark-academia
"A HOTEL ROOM IN PARIS #31 At the bottom of the lonely window, The sky looks almost velvety lilac. While at the top, the window frame Seems to drown in front of an ocean of blue satin. White window frames in uneven walls Cast no shadow, so the light projects the soul of each traveller instead. So I sit here in silence, filtering out the noise That the boulevards inhabit and sing each day. Only the music I keep in my room, the silent solitude each one carries; Carries far and – may I hope – home soon.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"Paris The Seine dresses in light black, Mimicking the dark grey of the sky, And so, I drown my ink into it. Each poem becomes art, Reflecting and dancing Around my hands with care. The notes the river shares Become a painting that inspires All the great artists housed in its museums. Still, I vow and pray by its sight — Yet I dare not claim to be an artist As great as the one in sight. In Paris.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"Parisian Endings Endings share a bond between right and wrong, Upon every poet who dares to cross a line. The Parisian sky glows light with blue and orange, Each hill a line of fortune, unique to every soul. Words cross the heart I call cœur, And dawn in the same eternal hues behind her. By noon, I become the city itself, Only to return as her passenger, By walking far enough to lose her.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"I Am the City The spaces between streets, The lights that bloom on corners, The lines that hold us together. I may be a name, I may be a crossroad, I may be a saint. I am a city. I am a name. I am.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"A Line Across the Seine Whatever I made of you Surrenders to beauty. For I am a simple line That crosses the Seine, Remembering each wave Upon the stones of light. However often the light shines Towards the blue of morning skies, I’ll be here. I’ll write.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"The City That Holds Me The sidewalks I stumble on more than once Make me feel like I am walking home. The place cold enough to die for, Yet I walk towards the next day without freezing. The river that drowns my words, As I wander its same stretch, up and down. My chapels know my favourite corners, Where I light my candles each good Sunday.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"Pothole in the Sky My veins ground too deep to become a statue, And the flight is delayed too late— So I take off again. I take off without the vein of the city That lifts me to heaven with a million lights And a few streets in between. The darkness blooms like a desert, And in my aeroplane, I become a small flower, Travelling too far and without sight. Clouds outside windows become a stair frame, And the dark blue of mornings drifts by, While I dream of Paris and every thought That drifted by.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia

"Killing is why I exist,"" she said finally. ""It is my only love. I used to struggle with my temper, but now I embrace it. You cannot fathom how many I have slain, both mortal and Folk. Why should a little nothing like you be the end of me?"" ""You know why,"" I said. ""Because it would be a fitting conclusion."" She gave me the sort of look that reminded me of Razkarden when he sizes up a potential meal. The shadow in the room seemed to deepen, redden, and grow damp, a slippery damp I felt through my shoes. I only waited. ""Well?"" I said. She seemed to deflate slightly, and the illusion vanished. ""You wish to find the door to Death?"" she said, a slyness entering her voice. ""Very well. I will tell you how. But I must be allowed to depart this realm unharmed."" I could see she expected me to protest or bargain with her. ""Done,"" I said. Her lip curled. ""Such a dull little thing,"" she said. ""You have no spirit worth breaking, I see. You are not like your grandfather at all."" ""And you are not as frightening as you think you are,"" I said.",Heather Fawcett,dark-academia
"The Weight of Falling Leaves Winter swept onto my doorstep quite easily, Like it overtook every part of my heart, The moment you left my autumn to fall. So I kept things as you left them – frozen, Showing no sign of any emotion or feeling, Like the leaves that wither and die in the ice. Never fulfilling the purpose for which they fell, Yet crumbling under shoes heavier than the burden The tree gave them by letting them go. They long to be carried away by the wind or the elements, Not trapped forever in this frozen expanse of white, Beneath starry skies that gaze upon each December night. I can no longer bear to look upon them, So I set them free with a kiss to keep; Filled with the fire of your lips, finally redeemed – See how they gleam with beauty, long before spring.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia

All The Ink I Wasted All the ink I wasted Climbing up ivory pages and cursive titles Of whoever asked to buy and sell - Words and souls and hope and pain. All the nights I spent Crying out to the world what I thought Or blaming myself for not hearing back - Worlds are crashing inside myself. All the fights I fought Calming my strife to succeed and feel Overwhelming hopes and dreams in spare - Wondering if I write my fate or dare to seal. All the wasted words Counting each number up I tried to spell Only to be reminded of despair once again - Worth is nothing nowadays with a price to sell.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"What Other Can a Man Lay but Tragedy? What other can a man lay but tragedy? No other thing would be ripe in time. Grief is a flower that blooms often, And sorrow is the rain that waters it sometimes. Each man reaps what he once sows— With pain, and some with bitter ease. The sky above every head of gloom Grows thicker with clouds and earthly deeds. The field does not bloom in summer But on the last day of every man's each.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia

"I Will Go Back to Paris in Spring I will go back to Paris in spring, To see its life and not the still, To watch the sky in a different hue, With the same buildings at each rue.

"We Haunt the People We Love We haunt the people that we love, And we become ruins by doing so. Chasing them down every line, No matter if spoken or lived by it.

"And autumn died long before the sun touched the last leaf; for death forgets every winter for as long as summer blossoms for itself; For the art of everyone is close to the idea and dwells in thoughts.

"PRISONS/GARDENS Cages are made for people living on the outside to catch things evil, beautiful or just unaccepted; Nothing ever outgrows the space of captivity nor does it ever bloom.

THE SHEETS & THE LIGHT Sombre echoes that mark the dawning greying on the hill; the steep streets still wet from rain the small buildings look emptier with each day passing on; Thoughts are done passing rounds counting circles inside my head. Pale mirror-faces crossing me on the way back to the place that felt like home - falling back in time.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"COLOURS IN THE MIRROR One day my pride will outlive myself and whatever remains of its colours will be remembered by others - for I was always my true self. I live too little for things that make me dream & care too much for fears that sleep in between the fine lines of my weary mind - so write me gentle words, for it may break. My diversity should not be a mistake but a celebration of identity & guiding light to others who ache to leave the numbness of »pretending-to-be«. We are not broken mirrors that hurt the world by showing our true reflection; we are merely hearts used to rejection - yet, their words will only blur but not break our shine.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
ATHENA They fall silently. the steps of her arrival - crossing snow so pale even the morning sky would fade into nightfall's amber; For she has entered the palace of gold - her hair braided with hope and tainted with red leaves which colours remind of a hanged man's rope - for her name is war and her crown is crafted out of grief.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"CROSSROAD Lights flicker above the crossroad shining in green now and then for people who won't cross and red for others - which won't stop; The dull grey splits the city in pieces of lines and corners, sometimes outshined by heavy rain and flooded glimpses of chaos; Broken glass upon crimson roads empty silence and nothing to say - while the city sleeps on and will awake, eventually.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"PIECES OF LIGHT I see the art of each heart reflecting the mirror that the world put it in front of - for so long that the lines so once so clear became hate for everything we see - blurring out the real; Seeing a thousand lights reflecting one's own means nothing anymore, now that we live by the one offered by the world; The price of being a small part of everyone's standard is being praised so, we may break into one single piece.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
ASBOLUTION Our paradise is not made out of worldly things but of the broken fragments of heaven - laced with doubt and forgiveness; Nearly silent we promise each other absolutisation for every promise we ever dared to make with words and deeds - yet I feel incomplete.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
WEDNESDAY MIRAGE How far do they reach the rivers of our grieve - far beyond the horizon and deep into a soul; Suffering can feel like drowning in numbness and being awake for days; It's roots growing further then our mind can go and make dark a heart that once was full of light;,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"THE MEADOWS OF MEDEA 'The meadows lay weeping with tears like an emerald's gleam; while every nightingale is seeking the shelter of its only willow's green. And silently, my step falls on leaves that carry me much further than I'd dream; for willows and thoughts are fading slowly while everything eternal is not seen - and yet they keep so many of us in good company - for some can not be on their own, nor can they be free. So I found peace, the one eternal each one seeks and so I left my soul for emerald's gleam; while the meadows still lay weeping with grief over my grave so quietly for it lays beneath the shadow of its only willow's green.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"MARBLE GRAVES The silver moon stands silent between two cypresses - its light leaning against the walls of the old palazzo that lays in ruin. Hidden behind olive groves lays the tomb of forgotten men and unsung heroes. Their souls found peace within the Allgrove's of singing cicadas and rustling long grass. The marble is heavy and their graves cool and dark - deep is their sleep eternal their demise. The moon is slowly covered by a shroud of clouds, cypresses now lay in darkness - silence.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"OUR OLYMP At this altitude of wavering faith and dying stars our love could not stand a chance; it disappears slowly within my rhymes sky. Fading along the pale darkness like a path of crumbling anecdotes on old crumpled philosophers' notes. I can not see the moon anymore - neither I can imagine the place where it should rest tonight in the sky of ours, where it used to be so bright. The Gods themselves dare not make a home at this height of our hearts, for even the immortals would refuse to hold sacred a place so high. Even our wishes refuse to fall at the mountains feet, still climbing, trembling, and slowly loosing - defeat.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"DYSTOPIA Dark, early streets and high walls of empty houses a lonesome bird singing a hollow duet with its own echo - autumn feels like spring once you have lost everything and stand with nothing to hold onto at winter's edge - walkways glooming in buzzing orange neon light imitating fallen leaves, making the city's concrete jungle a forest - soon November is here, crawling along the pavement and dulling the grey of the ruins they call buildings - sudden flickering accompanied by loud buzzing: the lights went out while winter's edge cuts violently through the streets & building cracks - the bird stopped singing.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"FLORENCE Soft emerald valleys lay in crimson light beneath the rolling hills; the waters of the Arno gleam like bronze the city's vein, so still. Each artist at the shore of the river stares in wonder and delight - how far do the lines reach across the bridge, beyond their work? One may seek rest under the cypresses and soft light of the August amber sun - here, at his grave, the city walls lay high around the garden, he knew once as paradise. His dark eyes still seem to pierce the lines of the hills, like he searches for his soul - still; (somewhere between the Arno and the nightfall). The trees - heavily laid with summer's fruit - stand high above the city in marble glance. Clear is now the dark sky - full of shards which dreamers call the stars.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"THE MONSTER & THE MAN One obstacle pierces his soul and calls him down the dark road - heavy sighing he must carry on and at last, the thorn is retrieved - with agony in his brown eyes - he suddenly sees: Fever dreams, scarlet on blue velvet, like ink drowning in words - words drowning inside his veins - words that pleaded in vain - words so scarlet... so stained. Empty lines for empty souls that carry too much inside; empty pages for empty hands with nothing else to hide nor to control the beast inside his soul.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"SIENA I wander down the steps along the walls of bricks and high houses - down to the waters that lay deep. Streaming down from the hill on which the old city was built with a tower standing high, that reaches up not far from the grave that these waters lay in. Alabaster is the hand that reaches in it and cold is the heart that touches the pale divine. Beating fast after climbing back to the light and narrow streets - I found now what it seeks. Descending down, down to the hidden stream - oh Siena, my goddess without a pomegranate seed.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"THE BALLADE OF SUMMER'S FALL Hues of pale green, on delicate olive branches the soft rustling of somberness along the fields of gold that lay themselves to gentle rest after another long summer. I have nothing to bury under them except my own heart -that is my soul's greatest regret, once my lines begin to fill in autumn, under the velvet gloom of shortening days. The admiration of the Florentine sun had doomed my words to become eventually a remembrance once September falls in October's pale hands. I shall have nothing to grieve for once the winter arrives, coming over the distant hills and laying bare the orchards along his way. I doomed them to become ruins by overthinking, hoping - at least once too often - for change; So, let it be then. I will mourn my mere passion for life in the presence of death - though my art may be eternal.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia

"SAN GIMIGNANO The towers align the hills like crowns of heavy stones; Empty are the dreams of the ones that built them long ago. The thirst for power still stands frozen in its tracks - the only witnesses of it stand high against the silver sky. The distance gets smaller, and the towers become higher. So many have fallen, laying their family's name to rest, in gentle forgetfulness.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"A POET'S HOMAGE TO FLORENCE What heart dares to look upon a city so golden and is not moved to write a single line? Whose soul can bear such beauty and not praise it with all its words?

My love, your likeness is like marble that makes the altar of paradise.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"PERSEPHONE (the spring ballade) Every heart is blooming upon a field of doubt and the flowers autumn reaps - he knows every name about. They grow never in line, although always in the shape of each soul of every lonesome doubt. So whenever I wander along my sorrow's path the horizon behind me glows crimson with all the broken hearts it carries on. A thought yet not dreamt is a love unplanted by hands of grieve - For each who does not bloom by now is long lost in summer's eyes, For autumn reaps but does not give a single tear to water the ground in which he steers sometimes so aimlessly.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia

"Lorelei wanted forever to bask in the light of her smile. She wanted to be carried on the current of her whims. She wanted to argue with her until she was breathless. She wanted to hurt her exquisitely, again and again, for as much time as they had. The depth of her hunger frightened her.",Allison Saft,dark-academia

"3 A.M. SAINTS It is 3 a.m. again and you are showing me all of your sins by holding up your scars to the starless sky. Painting the entire universe with gold and clothing my velvet heart in purple - we become saints within those unholy hours close to dawn. Still, the world is spinning - even though it feels a little slower now - while the silence carries us away into the next day.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"October creeps into the room through faint grey light that stopped dancing on the windowsill since July left. Being haunted by silence makes the air grow weary and faintly colder. I hear the noise of people walking in solitude, thinking to themselves about others— sitting alone in between their steps. Company of ghosts on lonely eves, threading through the rustling of leaves. I can write down what haunts me, yet I cannot read the ones who do. October.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia

"I learned how to survive in the cutthroat world of girl-hood, where are all strangeness was unrooted as ruthlessly as weeds from a garden. I domesticated my own wildness, starved the odd appetites inside me. I remade myself into Laura the saint, Laura who is reliable and dependable, if a little boring.",S.T. Gibson,dark-academia
"He had promised to let Julian speak without arguing; the promise was the only thing that kept him steady. There was no revering him anymore. Only love remained, and it was a fragile thing that Paul had been desperate not to see. He couldn't stand to look at the truth, even now. All they were--all they had ever been was a pair of sunflowers who each believed the other was the sun.",Micah Nemerever,dark-academia
"I always tried to hold on to the beautiful things, never realising that true beauty lies in letting go.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia

EDINBURGH Sombre echoes that mark the dawning that is greying on the hills; the steep streets still wet from rain the small buildings look emptier with each day passing on; thoughts are done passing rounds - counting circles inside my head. pale faces of familiar strangers crossing me on the way back to a place that used to feel like home - falling back in time.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
VALLEY The valleys climb towards the sky in the early morning hours - seeking horizon's lines; More than the gravestones do with all the memory lined neatly up and half-forgotten - nearly washed away. Our sun is doomed to meet both.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"A SIMPLE DRAFT Sometimes a simple draft can make a poet whole that is left with half a heart and feelings for a hundred it would take to bear. A few words can cover the whole world, creating light for the darkest of lines one can call a home or paradise - only a few can also lay bare their soul.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"CONFESSION Sometimes I feel like the lines of mine are in the way of every love that tries to cross the last bridge I have left leading to my heart. For I burned every other one while numbing the wounds the fire caused - setting alight to all that is left of me. I must admit that I kept on to the match, long after it burned down and reached my fingertips.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"BLOOMING SCARS Those flowers dance around vour marble bust like they were fearing October's kiss - gently they laugh and fall asleep on vour stone veins and cold lips. For they love their names written upon your chest in gold for your heart may be broken, yet it is searching for something untold. They do not know that silver mends the scars that the years formed and the cracks on your skin the sun caused - so silent, still, and weary are the blossoms with whom my love for you is betrothed.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
STARVING PIECES A heart starved of love will break itself and shed the pieces quickly - so it has less to feed with love.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"CHURCH WINDOWS ARE MY MIRRORS Blessed are the scars and the holiness of our hearts. Only saints break it without remorse for sinners, I expect nothing else but playing their part with our gentle soul. Church windows are my mirrors and prayers my gate to heavens end - I find everything by losing myself-nothing was ever lost from the beginning.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"AMBER HEART'S Amber chases the night sky like the stars became fire and gold - and the moon is falling ever closer to the sun he loves so much; So there is not much pain with the world to share, yet we begin to doubt our love and forget our hearts need care. Still, we wish upon the stars to fall faster in love than we did out, so we won't try and pull back for broken hearts are heavy and hard to catch. So while the constellations fade and our souls disappear in their entanglement we hope to learn what it means to truly live again the least.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"QUIET WRITING Quiet does not mean that we have nothing to say, or that we leak the power of speech - we rise up and tell our truths even if it feels like people don't like it the least; Writing is our means to have something to tell when we lost our voice suddenly we still stand behind our truths even if it feels like people won't like it. Beautifully are the quiet lines written with thunder and silent boldness - for we can have a revolution inside the pages of nowadays.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"THE ART OF EVERYONE And autumn died long before the sun touched the last leaf; for death forgets every winter for as long as summer blossoms for itself; For the art of everyone is close to the idea and dwells in thoughts. For every thought rises in the morning - and every beginning is the closest to us in the end, and eventually takes a lifetime to complete itself.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
I can not kiss you unless you unraveled every line of my heart and declared with your lips the beauty of our unfading love.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"Autumn sharpens the night air and paints the morning gold on the edge of winter’s silver breath, dancing delicately between life and death, between 4 pm and 3 am.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"At a certain point, you no longer hope; you just keep on existing. One day at a time, for the rest of your life. And that feeling is not shallow but runs deep— deeper than any happiness or love could ever run. A vein is a mere line poets like me used to write on and a lifeline where sailors swim towards at night. If we keep on writing and giving, we grow on that existing line with millions of words that save hope - and thus give existence and life.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"OCTOBER MORNINGS How your eyes gleamed like emeralds once autumn's first day arrived, how amber was the glance that met my tired eyes. Like silk was the light of morning that came through half-shut doors and made a line of gold upon our bedroom floor. Silent creeks empty hallways full of doubt, the room is empty now.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
"And she wondered: if he were a painting, could she read him better?",Megan Scott,dark-academia
"The Great Library of Alyssium, with its soaring spires, stained-glass windows, and labyrinthine bookshelves, was the jewel of the Crescent Islands Empire. Its hallowed stacks were filled with centuries-old treatises, histories, studies, and (most importantly, in Kiela's opinion) spellbooks. Only the elite, the crème de la crème of the scholars, were allowed to even view the spellbooks, as only the rarefied few were permitted, by imperial law, to use magic.",Sarah Beth Durst,dark-academia
"WE ARE OUR OWN CREATION How high a sinful mind can wander before it reaches heaven? How deep a second love can run before it is forgiven? How many lines a poet can write before being criticised? How many lines can a painter create before being copied? I say, there is no limit to any of these for we are still our own creation.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
Everything outside of our mind is endless - so why limit oneself?,Laura Chouette,dark-academia

You can not break my heart - and call the lines you write on art.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
A reverie is one soul’s river; but a word is one heart’s vein.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
There is a part of you I can't entirely forget - where my memories grow flowers and our past outreaches the gates of my garden; where the words I rather forget become a book of regret.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia

"The meadows lay weeping with tears like an emeralds gleam; while every nightingale is seeking the shelter of its only willow's green. - And silently, my step falls on leaves that carry me much further than I'd dream; for willows and thoughts are fading slowly while everything eternal is not seen and yet they keep so many of us in good company for some can not be on their own, nor can they be free. - So I found peace, the one eternal each one seeks and so I left my soul for emerald's gleam; while the meadow still lays weeping with grief over my grave so quietly for it lays beneath the shadow of its only willow's green.",Laura Chouette,dark-academia
I used to paint the world golden while drowning inside the silver of your words.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
The lights are gone yet your absence makes even the darkness tremble - for nothing feels as empty as a place without you.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
And if everything we love is considered art then our love is the greatest masterpiece.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
I touched each star you collected for me in vain; Only to see my sky fade inside the glimmer of a dream.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
I kept every letter - only to be remembered of the wrong one’s words can cause (to the heart).,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
Twice my heart broke for a love so delicate as my own; and yet I did not find a piece of myself in between those lines.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
Love is too much for our generation - that’s why it dies inside our hands but blooms at our feet.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
There is something tragic within one's love.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
We all admire the night sky and its infinite beauty; not realising that everything in it shines on its own. And maybe that's the reason why empty hearts and lonely souls crave these quiet hours.,Laura Chouette,dark-academia
