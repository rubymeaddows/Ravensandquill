"In short: I felt my existence was tainted, in some subtle but essential way.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Are you always up this early?' I asked him. 'Almost always,' he said without looking up. 'It's beautiful here, but morning light can make the most vulgar things tolerable.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"But one mustn't underestimate the primal appeal—to lose one's self, lose it utterly. And in losing it be born to the principle of continuous life, outside the prison of mortality and time.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"It is a terrible thing to learn as a child that one is a being separate from all the world, that no one and no thing hurts along with one's burned tongues and skinned knees, that one's aches and pains are all one's own. Even more terrible, as we grow older, to learn that no person, no matter how beloved, can ever truly understand us. Our own selves make us most unhappy, and that's why we're so anxious to lose them...",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
There is nothing wrong with the love of Beauty. But Beauty -unless she is wed to something more meaningful -is always superficial,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
There's no 'rational grounds' for anything I care about.,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"I believe having a great diversity of teachers is harmful and confusing for a young mind, in the same way I believe that it is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"It is a terrible thing to learn as a child that one is a being separate from the world, that no one and no thing hurts along with one's burned tongues and skinned knees, that one's aches and pains are all one’s own. Even more terrible, as we grow old, to learn that no person, no matter how beloved, can ever truly understand us.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Though Julian could be marvelously kind in difficult circumstances of all sorts, I sometimes got the feeling that he was less pleased by kindness itself than by the elegance of the gesture.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"But walking through it all was one thing; walking away, unfortunately, has proved to be quite another, and though once I thought I had left that ravine forever on an April afternoon long ago, now I am not so sure. Now the searchers have departed, and life has grown quiet around me, I have come to realize that while for years I might have imagined myself to be somewhere else, in reality I have been there all the time: up at the top by the muddy wheel-ruts in the new grass, where the sky is dark over the shivering apple blossoms and the first chill of the snow that will fall that night is already in the air.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"We had not spoken about the incident in my room several nights before and, in the drowsy silence of the car, I felt the need to make things plain. “You know, Francis,” I said. “What?” It seemed the best thing was just to come right out and say it. “You know,” I said, “I’m really not attracted to you. I mean, not that—” “Isn’t that interesting,” he said coolly. “I’m really not attracted to you, either.” “But—” “You were there.” We drove the rest of the way to school in a not very comfortable silence.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Though not untidy, exactly, it verged on being so. Books were stacked on every available surface; the tables were cluttered papers, ashtrays, bottles of whiskey, boxes of chocolates; umbrellas and galoshes made passage difficult in the narrow hall… Camilla’s night table was littered with empty teacups, leaky pens, dead marigolds in a water glass, and at the foot of her bed was a half-played game of solitaire… everywhere I looked was some fresh oddity: an old stereopticon, arrowheads in a dusty glass case, a staghorn fern, a bird’s skeleton…",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"...And besides, is death really so terrible a thing? It seems terrible to you, because you are young, but who is to say he is not better off now than you are? Or - if death is a journey to another place - that you will not see him again?",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Well, it's not called a mystery for nothing,"" said Henry sourly. ""Take my word for it. But one mustn't underestimate the primal appeal to lose one's self, lose it utterly. And in losing it be born to the principle of continuous life, outside the prison of mortality and time. That was attractive to me from the first, even when I knew nothing about the topic and approached it less as potential mystes than anthropologist. Ancient commentators are very circumspect about the whole thing. It was possible, with a great deal of work, to figure out some of the sacred rituals-the hymns, the sacred objects, what to wear and do and say. More difficult was the mystery itself: how did one propel oneself into such a state, what was the catalyst?"" His voice was dreamy, amused. ""We tried everything. Drink, drugs, prayer, even small doses of poison.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"And I feel I have something very serious and urgent to say to you, my non-existent reader, and I feel I should say it as urgently as if I were standing in the room with you. That life—whatever else it is—is short. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn’t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open. And in the midst of our dying, as we rise from the organic and sink back ignominiously into the organic, it is a glory and a privilege to love what Death doesn’t touch.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Richard Papen: As it happened, I knew Gartrell. He was a bad painter and a vicious gossip, with a vocabulary composed almost entirely of obscenities, gutteral verbs, and the world ""postmodernist.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"I have only to glance over my shoulder for all those years to drop away and I see it behind me again, the ravine, rising all green and black through the saplings, a picture that will never leave me.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"«Perché quella piccola voce ostinata nella nostra testa ci tormenta così?» disse , guardandoci. «Forse perché ci ricorda che siamo vivi, che siamo mortali, che abbiamo anime autonome - che, dopotutto, siamo troppo pavidi per cedere, ma che pure ci procurano un grave malessere? È una cosa terribile imparare da bambini che si è un essere separato dal resto del mondo, che niente e nessuno soffre i nostri medesimi solori di scottature alla lingua o di sbucciature alle ginocchia: che ognuno è solo con i propri acciacchi e le proprie pene, Ancor più terribile, invecchiando, scoprire che nessuna persona - non importa quanto vicina - potrà mai capirci davvero. I nostri io sono ciò che ci rende più infelici, ed è per questo che bramiamo perderli, non credere?»",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"well that's the wonderful thing about books, that's the thing that books can do that no other art form can do: when we read a great book we do internalize it, it becomes part of us; when we read a great book we put it down and we're different people.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
La bellezza è raramente dolce o consolatoria. Quasi l'opposto. La vera bellezza è sempre un po' inquietante.,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"What do you think about America?"" ""Everyone always smiles so big! Well—most people. Maybe not so much you. I think it looks stupid.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Sometimes when there's been an accident and reality is too sudden and strange to comprehend, the surreal will take over",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
you can live many lives by reading books.,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"All of a sudden, images from every crime movie I'd ever seen began to pop into my mind—the windowless room, the harsh lights and narrow hallways, images which did not seem so much theatrical or foreign as imbued with the indelible quality of memory, of experience lived.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Things would have turned out better is she had lived. As it was, she died when I was kid;and thought everything that happened to me since then is thoroughly my own fault, still when I lost her I lost sight of any landmark that might have led me someplace happier, to some more populated or congenial life.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
Her death the dividing mark: Before and After.,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
Psychology is a terrible a word.,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Sunday was a sad day-early to bed, school the next morning, I was constantly worried my homework was wrong-but as I watched the fireworks go off in the night sky, over the floodlit castles of Disneyland, was consumed by a more general sense of dread, of imprisonment I within the dreary round of school and home: circumstances which, to me at least, presented sound empirical argument for gloom. My father was mean, and our house ugly, and my mother didn't pay much attention to me; my clothes were cheap and my haircut too short and no one at school seemed to like me that much; and since all this had been true for as long as I could remember, I felt things would doubtless continue in this depressing vein as far as I could foresee. In short: I felt my existence was tainted, in some subtle but essential way.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"<> continuò Julian, <>",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"E per quanto mi piacerebbe credere che ci sia un verità dietro l'illusione, mi sono convinto che non c'è alcuna verità dietro l'illusione. Perché, tra la ""relatà"" da un lato, e il punto in cui la mente va a sbattere contro la realtà, esiste uno spazio sottile, uno spicchio d'arcobaleno da cui origina la bellezza, il punto in cui due superfici molto diverse tra loro si mescolano e si confondono per procurare ciò che la vita non ci dà: e questo è lo spazio in cui tutta l'arte prende forma, e tutta la magia.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Out in the country it was not uncommon to discover that she had slipped away, alone, out to the lake, maybe, or down to the cellar, where once I found her sitting in the big marooned sleigh, reading, her fur coat thrown over her knees. Things would have been terrible strange and unbalanced without her. She was the Queen who finished out the suit of dark Jacks, dark King, and Joker.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"It was a clear, black morning, encrusted with stars.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
In this swarm of cigarettes and dark sophistication they appeared here and there like figures from an allegory; or long-dead celebrants from some forgotten garden party,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"I was confused by this sudden glare of attention; it was as if the characters in a favorite painting, absorbed in their own concerns, had looked up out of the canvas and spoken to me.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
I was as depressed as I have ever been in my life.,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"The ceilings had set off a ghostly echo, giving all that desperate hilarity the quality of a memory even as I sat listening to it, memories of things I'd never known.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"I am gifted at blending myself into any given milieu—you've never seen such a typical California teenager as I was, nor such a dissolute and callous pre-med student—but somehow despite my efforts, I am never able to blend myself in entirely and remain in some respects quite distinct from my surroundings, in the same way that a green chameleon remains a distinct entity from the leaf upon which it sits, no matter how perfectly it has approximated the the subtleties of the particular shade.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"But, if I dare say it, it wasn't until I had helped kill a man that I realized how elusive and complex an act a murder can actually be, and not necessarily attributable to one dramatic motive.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"In fact, I can't think of much I'd like better than for him to step into the room right now, glasses fogged and smelling of damp wool, shaking the rain from his hair like an old dog and saying: 'Dickie, my boy, what you got for a thirsty old man to drink tonight?",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Occasionally a car swooshed by in the rain and its headlights would swing round momentarily and illuminate the room-the pool table, snowshoes on the wall and the rowing machine, the armchair in which Henry sat, motionless, a glass in his hand and the cigarette burning low between his fingers. For a moment his face, pale and watchful as a ghost's, would be caught in the headlights and then, very gradually, it would slide back into the dark.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Out on the lawn, Bunny had just knocked Henry's ball about seventy feet outside the court. There was a ragged burst of laughter; faint, but clear, it floated back across the evening air. That laughter haunts me still.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Lo so, lo so, ma ascoltami. Hai letto L’idiota, vero? Sì. Beh, L’idiota è un libro molto inquietante per me. Mi ha fatto così effetto che dopo non ho quasi più letto romanzi, a parte roba tipo ‘Uomini che odiano le donne’. Perché… provavo a intromettermi, …be’, magari me lo dici dopo, a cosa pensavi, lasciami finire di dirti perché l’ho trovato inquietante. Perché tutto quello che Myškin fa è buono… altruista… tratta tutti con compassione e comprensione e a cosa porta tutta quella bontà? Omicidi! Disastri! Una volta mi preoccupavo un sacco di questa cosa. Me ne stavo sveglio a letto di notte e mi preoccupavo! Perché – perché? Com'era possibile? Ho letto quel libro tre volte, pensando di non averlo capito. Myškin era gentile, amava la gente, era tenero, perdonava sempre, non faceva mai niente di sbagliato – ma si fidava di tutte le persone sbagliate, prendeva solo decisioni sbagliate, faceva soffrire tutti quelli che gli stavano intorno. Quel libro contiene un messaggio oscuro. “A che pro essere buoni?” Ma – questo è ciò che ho capito ieri notte, mentre guidavo. E se… se fosse più complicato di così? Se fosse vero anche il contrario? Perché se è vero che il male può discendere dalle buone azioni… dove sta scritto che da quelle cattive può venire solo il male? Magari a volte – il modo sbagliato è quello giusto? Magari prendi la strada sbagliata e ti porta comunque dove volevi? O vedila in un altro modo, certe volte puoi sbagliare tutto, e alla fine viene fuori che andava bene?",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
In my own humorless state I failed to see anything except what I construed as certain tragic similarities between Gatsby and myself.,Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"The lamplight was eerie, and, standing there motionless in our bathrobes, sleepy, with shadows flickering all around, I felt as though I had woken from one dream into an even more remote one, some bizarre wartime bomb shelter of the unconscious.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"I slept all day, face down in the pillow, a comfortable dead-man's float only remotely disturbed by a chill undertow of reality—talk, footsteps, slamming doors—which threaded fitfully through the dark, blood-warm waters of dream.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"I believehaving a great diversity of teachers is harmful and confusing for a young mind, in the same way I believe that it is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Rise. «I grandi quadri – la gente accorre per vederli, attirano folle, sono riprodotti all’infinito sulle tazze e sui tappetini dei mouse e su qualunque cosa. E, questo riguarda anche me, puoi passare una vita intera a visitare musei con grande piacere, un bel giretto, e poi via, a pranzo da qualche parte. Ma…» tornò a sedersi sul tavolo, «se un quadro ti affonda davvero nel cuore e cambia il tuo modo di vedere, e di pensare, e di provare emozioni, non pensi, “oh, amo questo quadro perché è universale”, “amo questo quadro perché parla a tutto il genere umano”. Non è questa la ragione per cui ci si innamora di un’opera d’arte. È un sospiro segreto in un vicolo. Pss, tu. Ehi ragazzino. Sì, proprio tu.»",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
"Argentina . The word itself had lost little of its power to startle and had, due to my ignorance of the physical place it occupied on the globe, assumed a peculiar life of its own. There was the harsh Ar at the beginning, which called up gold, idols, lost cities in the jungle, which in turn led to the hushed and sinister chamber of Gen, with the bright, interrogative Tina at the end—all nonsense, of course, but then it seemed in some muddled way that name itself, one of the few concrete facts available to me, might itself be a cryptogram or clue.",Donna Tartt,donna-tartt
