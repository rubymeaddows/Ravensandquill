In the rapture of my enormous humiliation I live in your warm life, and you shall die—die, sweetly die—into mine.

"Once upon a time it was not safe to be born a girl. It is important to remember that time does not exist. Once upon a time, all of time, it was not safe to be a girl. Lecherous men would disguise themselves as kittens left for dead by their mothers so that little girls would pick them up and kiss their eyes into vision and then the kittens would grow and grow until they were bigger and fiercer than lions and they would eat the girls in one bite, bones and skin and hair and all. Once upon a time it was not safe to be born a girl because either you were the kitten abandoned in a dumpster or you were devoured by it.

"Never before had I felt trapped, so seduced and caught up in a story,' Clara explained, 'the way I did with that book. Until then, reading was just a duty, a sort of fine one had to pay teachers and tutors without quite knowing why. I had never known the pleasure of reading, of exploring the recesses of the soul, of letting myself be carried away by imagination, beauty, and the mystery of fiction and language. For me all those things were born with that novel. This is a world of shadows, Daniel, and magic is a rare asset. That book taught me that by reading, I could live more intensely. It could give me back the sight I had lost. For that reason alone, a book that didn't matter to anyone, changed my life.",Carlos Ruiz Zafón,gothic

Your god has arrived with enough hatred for y’all, with enough evil for the big and small, so come one, come all. I will shred your souls and place them in my satchel, call you a settler and make you my peddler. Come one, come all, come stand behind your god. I will lead you into the darkness of Earth's end. Come one, come all, my wilted flowers, come claim your title, speak out and cheer it. Come one, come all, let’s have a ball, my wilted flowers . . . Sweet, Unconquerable Spirits.",A.K.

"Gormenghast. Withdrawn and ruinous it broods in umbra: the immemorial masonry: the towers, the tracts. Is all corroding? No. Through an avenue of spires a zephyr floats; a bird whistles; a freshet beats away from a choked river. Deep in a fist of stone a doll's hand wriggles, warm rebellious on the frozen palm. A shadow shifts its length. A spider stirs... And darkness winds between the characters. - Gormenghast",Mervyn Peake,gothic
"It was now autumn, and I made up my mind to make, before winter set in, an excursion across Normandy, a country with which I was not acquainted. It must be borne in mind that I began with Rouen, and for a week I wandered about enthusiastic with admiration, in that picturesque town of the Middle Ages, in that veritable museum of extraordinary Gothic monuments. Well, one afternoon, somewhere about four o'clock, as I happened to be passing down an out-of-the-way by-street, in the middle of which flowed a deep river, black as ink, named the Eau de Robec, my attention wholly directed to examining the bizarre and antique physiognomy of the houses, was all of a sudden attracted by the sight of a series of shops of furniture brokers, one after the other, from door to door along the street. Ah! these second-hand brokers had well chosen their locality, these sordid old traffickers of bric-a-brac, in this fantastic alley leading up from stream of that sinister dark water, under the steep pointed overhanging gables of tiled roofs and projecting shingle eaves, where the weathercocks of the past still creaked overhead. (""Who Knows?"")",Guy de Maupassant,gothic
"Sometimes I felt the bloated Toad, hideous and pampered with the poisonous vapours of the dungeon, dragging his loathsome length along my bosom: Sometimes the quick cold Lizard rouzed me leaving his slimy track upon my face, and entangling itself in the tresses of my wild and matted hair: Often have I at waking found my fingers ringed with the long worms which bred in the corrupted flesh of my Infant.",Matthew Gregory Lewis,gothic
"Wicked eyes are not a good prospect for seminary boys. They want a gentle, soft sort of wife, not a wife who looks as though she may sprout wings and carry off the young children of the village. ~Maria ""Smythe",Gwenn Wright,gothic
"He had gone again and, emboldened by his first successful trip, had chosen a different sort of world to enter, that of THE MONK. He had studied the book with great care and finally selected a passage that was purely descriptive. The result was the same. The instant he closed the top of the showcase, he was transported to the world described in the open pages. He found himself standing - and shivering - in a dank corridor that, he knew, was far underground. Feeble candlelight flickered in the distance, off to his left. Water dripped down the gleaming walls and startled rats scurried past his feet. The air was stale and unpleasant. Down the corridor to his left, he could hear singing but could not make out the words. Then suddenly, from his right, he heard a woman's high-pitched scream, its sound caroming off the wet, stone walls of the passageway. He jumped, his skin crawling at the back of his neck. And found himself back in his warm and familiar room. (""I Shall Not Leave England Now"")",Alan Ryan,gothic

"A Ravaging Sentinel's Vow by Stewart Stafford State your love for me now — Agreed, a cracked heart pledge, Defying your many flaws, martyring me to betrayal's dredge. At your darkest dawn — My fealty oath holds true, when every back is turned, a redeeming ravager’s purview. A sentinel’s dust trail climbs high, hooves thunder; the sundial stops, A vow declared, enemies routed, disaster reined on teetering clifftops. © 2025, Stewart Stafford.

"All beneath his eye was a solitude. The strange plants were basking in the sunshine, and now and then nodding gently to one another, as if in acknowledgment of sympathy and kindred. In the midst, by the shattered fountain, grew the magnificent shrub, with its purple gems clustering all over it; they glowed in the air, and gleamed back again out of the depths of the pool, which thus seemed to overflow with coloured radiance from the rich reflection that was steeped in it.",Nathaniel Hawthorne,gothic
"By all appreciable signs, they loved; they had looked love, with eyes that conveyed the holy secret from the depths of one soul into the depths of the other, as if it were too sacred to be whispered by the way; they had even spoken love, in those gushes of passion when their spirits darted forth in articulated breath, like tongues of long-hidden flame;",Nathaniel Hawthorne,gothic
"She was as lovely as the dawn, and gorgeous as the sunset",Nathaniel Hawthorne,gothic
"Memories brought madness with it; and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage; sometimes low and despondent; I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.",Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,gothic
"I know what you are,” I whispered. Adrian didn’t flinch. “Do you.” His voice was a low rasp. I reached into my clutch, pulled out a tiny shard of glass I’d kept from before—why, I didn’t even know—and without flinching, sliced my palm open. Blood welled instantly, hot and red. His nostrils flared. His eyes bled crimson. “You’re insane,” he growled, stepping back. “No,” I said, stepping forward. “I’m curious.” He moved in a blur, faster than I could blink, grabbing me by the throat—not hard enough to hurt, just enough to hold me still. His fangs had descended, sharp and glinting.",Alexa Carrington,gothic
"Sometimes I pretend my fear is a little rabbit in my chest. It's the sort of rabbit my brother's school tests their techniques on, with grey fur and dark eyes, and it hides underneath my sternum beside the heart.",Andrew Joseph White,gothic
"Ouija Board Web by Stewart Stafford Someone's been in my room, Helped themselves to my beer. Bottled my portal to escape, And left behind a sober fear. I guess I'll climb the silence, To the mirror, if I'm still here, Tap out a drowning rhythm, To send an S.O.S. so clear. A phantom knocking from within, Coins rub my spirit board away, Voices say breathe out and in, Darkest night blurs into day. Moth to the flame in a spider web, Mummified to twist in the draught, Here comes the eight-eyed sentinel, To finish its ice-cold Arachnid craft. © 2025, Stewart Stafford. All rights reserved.",Stewart Stafford,gothic
"She had always believed the shadows were empty, until they began to answer her back.",Gwendoline Vale,gothic
"We sat down on a rude bench, under a group of magnificent lime trees. The sun was setting with all its melancholy splendour behind the sylvan horizon, and the stream that flows beside our home, and passes under the steep old bridge I have mentioned, wound through many a group of noble trees, almost at our feet, reflecting in its current the fading crimson of the sky.",Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu,gothic

"Posed In Vein by Stewart Stafford O Stephanie! In your cruciform puppetry, Bloody veins stretched out wiry To relive in a bondage diary. Subject mapped as inked skin she wears, Decorating, desecrating olden snares. Each needle kiss, a line defined, A pinprick story rushes her mind. By candlelight, in her coven deep, Secrets webbed flies must keep, Spelled out straight in her hexing book, Consort Lenore gives a cryptic look. They tug the strings, the marionette, Caught in her captor's welcome net. In artificial light, a social moth's mien, A wrought, posed, fetishistic scene. The knots are tight, the ropes defined; Bodily and in private mind. This mutual art, a supplicant's plea, Cut into her Kinbaku diary. © 2025, Stewart Stafford.

"My body bucks and breaks beneath my hand; it is its own animal, with its own limits, that I have not cared to mind. It betrays me with its wants and needs, its pains and limitations, and I am furious to be tethered in this way. I thought us prisoners together, but perhaps we are enemies, working tirelessly to move in opposite directions.",Kat Dunn,gothic
"I am a woman woken from thirty years slumber, and I would eat the world should it satisfy this empty, keening void where my heart should be.

"—Usted es un hombre listo, amigo John; y tiene un ingenio agudo, pero tiene también demasiados prejuicios. No deja usted que sus ojos vean y que sus oídos escuchen, y lo que está más allá de su vida cotidiana no le interesa. ¿No piensa usted que hay cosas que no puede comprender, y que sin embargo existen? ¿Qué algunas personas pueden ver cosas y que otras no pueden? Pero hay cosas antiguas y nuevas que no deben contempladas por los ojos de los hombres, porque ellos creen o piensan creer en cosas que otros hombres les han dicho. ¡Ah, es error de nuestra ciencia querer explicarlo todo! Y si no puede explicarlo, dice que no hay nada que explicar. Pero usted ve alrededor de nosotros que cada día crecen nuevas creencias, que se consideran a sí mismas nuevas, y que sin embargo son las antiguas, que pretenden ser jóvenes como las finas damas en la ópera. Yo supongo que usted no cree en la transferencia corporal. ¿No? Ni en la materialización. ¿No? Ni en los cuerpos astrales. ¿No? Ni en la lectura del pensamiento. ¿No? Ni en el hipnotismo…",Bram Stoker,gothic
"Nothing Man by Stewart Stafford I return to plague night's wanderers, Dark hours and thoughts personified, Driven by this scorching crusade, Agitation flooding my skewed brain. Many have tried to kill me and failed, They think material weapons can work, I am immaterial and absorb punishment; An elemental fire they cannot extinguish. No targets are off limits to me, I fear, Aye, I am an equal opportunities predator, Praying for my victims as I prey upon them, Then am I consumed, at one with darkness. © 2025, Stewart Stafford. All rights reserved.",Stewart Stafford,gothic
No hay infierno peor que el de un habito del que no puedes librarte,Mike Ashley,gothic
"Snowbound Condemnation by Stewart Stafford My vigil for a shabby scarecrow, Cruciform in a snowdrift field, Its saviour-suited arms clawing At corvids, frozen heels to Heaven. Its mouth a wailing O-shape, Lamenting deafened ears of corn, Resuscitation for a fool's errand, In a hysterical chorus of biting gales. Haunting a sycamore tree, complicit, I witnessed desolation's spectacle, Half-expecting a condemned miracle, This pilgrim genuflected into green slush. © 2025, Stewart Stafford.
