"Many boys will bring you flowers. But someday you'll meet a boy who will learn your favorite flower, your favorite song, your favorite sweet. And even if he is too poor to give you any of them, it won't matter because he will have taken the time to know you as no one else does. Only that boy earns your heart.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"He needed to tell her...what? That she was lovely and brave and better than anything he deserved. That he was twisted, crooked, wrong, but not so broken that he couldn't pull himself together into some semblance of a man for her. That without meaning to, he'd begun to lean on her, to look for her, to need her near. He needed to thank her for his new hat.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Crows remember human faces. They remember the people who feed them, who are kind to them. And the people who wrong them too. They don’t forget. They tell each other who to look after and who to watch out for.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"This is what love does. In the stories, love healed your wounds, fixed what was broken, allowed you to go on. But love wasn’t a spell, some kind of benediction to be whispered, a balm or a cure-all. It was a single, fragile thread, which grew stronger through connection, through shared hardship and trust.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"There was no part of him that was not broken, that had not healed wrong, and there was no part of him that was not stronger for having been broken. No one knew who he was. No one knew where he came from. He'd become Kaz Brekker, cripple and confidence man, bastard of the Barrel. The gloves were his one concession to weakness. Since that night among the bodies and the swim from the Reaper's Barge, he had not been able to bear the feeling of skin against skin. It was excruciating to him, revolting. It was the only piece of his past that he could not forge into something dangerous.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Will you say it? ""Aleksander"" His grin faded and his grey eyes seemed to flicker. ""Again."" ""Aleksander",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Kaz reached into his coat pocket. ""Here,"" he said and handed Jesper a slender book with an elaborate cover. ""Are we going to read to each other?"" ""Just flip it open to the back."" Jesper opened the book and peered at the last page, puzzled. ""So?"" ""Hold it up so we don't have to look at your ugly face."" ""My face has character. Besides - oh!"" ""An excellent read, isn't it?"" ""Who knew I had a taste for literature?",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"There are rumors that your Lantsov prince has been sighted.” I drifted nearer, trying to keep my voice casual. “Where?” He glanced up, his lips curling in a slight smile. “Do you like him?” “Does it matter?” “It’s harder when you like them. You mourn them more.” “Tell me, Alina,” said the Darkling. “Has he claimed you yet?” “Claimed me? Like a peninsula?” “No blushes. No averted eyes. How you’ve changed. What about your faithful tracker? Will he sleep curled at the foot of your throne?",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"What is she to you anyway?"" ""Here's my answer captain. She's the thing that made this all okay-the threadbare coats and the old boots and the guns that jams when you most need them to fire, the loneliness of knowing that you don't matter, that you will never matter, the fact that you're just another body, another uniform to be sent into the fold or the frost, another good boy who knows his place, who does his job, who doesn't ask questions, who will lie down and die and be forgotten. What is she? She's everything, you dumb son of a bitch.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"He looked down at his boots. ""That berth belongs to you too. It will always be there when","if you want to come back."" Inej could not speak. Her heart felt too full",leigh-bardugo

"I will tell you a story, one I used to tell to a little boy with dark hair. A silent boy who rarely laughs, who listened more closely than I realized. A boy who had a name and not a title",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"I’ve been waiting for you a long time, Alina,” he said. “You and I are going to change the world.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"Pekka Rollins couldn't count the threats he'd heard, the men he'd killed, or the men he'd seen die, but the look in Brekker's eye still sent a chill slithering up his spine. Some wrathful thing in this boy was beginning to get loose, and Rollin's didn't want to be around when it slipped its leash.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"He made himself refocus on Inej's feet. ""Saints,"" he said. Inej grimaced. ""That bad?"" ""No, you just have really ugly feet."" ""Ugly feet that got you on this roof.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Magic doesn’t require beauty,’ she said. 'Easy magic is pretty. Great magic asks that you trouble the waters. It requires a disruption, something new.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Kaz heard Wylan retching. He tossed the eyeball overboard and jammed his spit-soaked handkerchief into the socket where Oomen's eye had been. Then he grabbed Oomen's jaw, his gloves leaving red smears on the enforcer's chin. His actions were smooth, precise, as if he were dealing cards at the Crow Club or picking an easy lock, but his rage felt hot and mad and unfamiliar. Something within him had torn loose.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Wanting is why people get up in the morning. It gives them something to dream of at night. The more I wanted, the more I became like them, the more real I became.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"The Darkling smiled, but this time the turn of his lips was cold. He shoved off the table and stalked toward me. “I will enter the Fold, Alina, and I will show West Ravka what I can do, even without the Sun Summoner. And when I have crushed Lantsov’s only ally, I will hunt you like an animal. You will find no sanctuary. You will have no peace.” He loomed over me, his gray eyes glinting. “Fly back home to your otkazat’sya,” he snarled. “Hold him tight. The rules of this game are about to change.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"It's shame that lines my pockets, shame that keeps the Barrel teeming with fools ready to put on a mask just so they can have what they want with no one the wiser for it. We can endure all kinds of pain. It's shame that eats men whole.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"You are strong enough to survive the fall. They were plummeting toward the sea. Zoya felt Genya’s arms around her, Liliyana holding her tight. She felt Nikolai’s presence beside her and Juris’ sword in her hands. With a wild, gasping breath, she felt her wings unfurl.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"He'd known even then, though: He'd start as a grunt, but the Dregs would become his army.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
This was the kiss he'd been waiting for. It was a gunshot. It was prairie fire. It was the spin of Makker's Wheel. Jesper felt the pounding of his heart - or was it Wylan's? - like a stampede in his chest.,Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
You are owed nothing. Steel is earned.,Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"I know what you thought, what you always thought of me. It's so much easier that way, isn't it?",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Kaz snagged her wrist. ""Inej."" His gloved thumb moved over her pulse, traced the top of the feather tattoo. ""If we don't make it out, I want you to know..."" She waited. She felt hope rustling its wings inside her, ready to take flight at the right words from Kaz. She willed that hope in to stillness. Those words would never come. The heart is an arrow. She reached up and touched his cheek. She thought he might flinch again, even knock her hand away. In nearly two years of battling side by side with Kaz, of late-night scheming, impossible heists, clandestine errands, and harried meals of fried potatoes and hutspot gobbled down as they rushed from one place to another, this was the first time she had touched him skin to skin, without the barrier of gloves or coat or shirtsleeve. She let her hand cup his cheek. His skin was cool and damp from the rain. He stayed still, but she saw a tremor pass through him, as if he were waging a war with himself. ""If we don't die this night, I will die unafraid, Kaz. Can you say the same?"" His eyes were nearly black, the pupils dilated. She could see it took every last bit of his terrible will for him to remain still beneath her touch. And yet, he did not pull away. She knew it was the best he could offer. It was not enough. She dropped her hand. He took a deep breath. Kaz had said he didn't want her prayers and she wouldn't speak them, but she wished him safe nonetheless. She had her aim now, her heart had direction, and though it hurt to know that path led away from him, she could endure it.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"He had become a great beast, and yet that beast would devour him",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
Why do you waste all of your strenght fighting your true nauture?,Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Kaz took a handkerchief from his coat pocket and carefully wiped his face clean. He thought of Inej lying still on the table, her slight weight in his arms. ""Hold him,"" he told Jesper and the Fjerdan. Kaz flicked his coat sleeve, and an oyster shucking knife appeared in his hand. At any given time he had at least two knives stashed somewhere in his clothes. He didn't even count this one, really -- a tidy, wicked little blade.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Because the whole world loves to tell us what we can’t do, that we aren’t good enough. The people in your own house should be on your side. It’s the people who never learn the word impossible who make history, because they’re the ones who keep trying.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"I'm sorry we don't visit more often. There's a war on and, well, no one likes you."" The Darkling touched a hand to his chest. ""You wound me."" ""All in good time,"" said Zoya.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Matthias knew monsters, and one look at Kaz Brekker had told him this was a creature who had spent too long in the dark- he'd brought something back with him when he crawled in to the light.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Human life is worth preserving. But human lives? They come and go like so much chaff, never tipping the scales."" ""What a remarkable calculation,"" said Nikolai. ""And a convenient one for a mass murderer.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"He thought of Inej's hand on his cheek. His mind had gone jagged at the sensation, a riot of confusion. It had been terror and disgust and- in all of that clamour- desire, a wish that lingered still, the hope that she would touch him again.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"When one plan was blown, you made a new one. When they backed you in to a corner, you cut a hole in the roof.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"If fate doesn't give us the chance, we steal it.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"What is this?"" she asked, her eyes scanning the page. ""It's not..."" She ran her fingertips over the words as if expecting them to vanish. ""My contract."" She whispered. ""I don't want you beholden to Per Haskell. Or me."" Another half-truth. His mind had concocted a hundred schemes to bind her to him, to keep her in this city. But she'd spent enough of her life caged by debts and obligations, and it would be better for them both when she was gone. ""How?"" she said. ""The money-"" ""It's done."" He'd liquidated every asset he had, used the last of the savings he'd accrued, every ill-gotten cent. She pressed the envelope to her chest, above her heart. ""I have no words to thank you for this."" ""Surely the Suli have a thousand words for such an occasion?"" ""Words have not been invented for such an occasion."" ""If I end up on the gallows, you can say something nice over the corpse,"" he said.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Cautiously, she let her knuckles brush against his, a slight weight, a bird's feather. He stiffened, but he didn't pull away. ""I'm not ready to give up on this city, Kaz. I think it's worth saving."" I think you're worth saving. Once they stood on the deck of a ship and she'd waited just like this. He had no spoken then and he did not speak now. Inej felt him slipping away, dragging under, caught in an undertow that would take him farther and farther from shore. She understood suffering and she knew it was a place she could not follow, not unless she wanted to drown, too. Back on Black Veil, he'd told her that they would fight their way out. Knives drawn, guns blazing. Because that's what we do. She would fight for him, but she could not heal him. She would not waste her life trying. She felt his knuckles slide against hers. Then his hand was in her hand, his palm was pressed against her own. A tremor moved through him. Slowly, he let their fingers entwine. For a long while, they stood there, hands clasped, looking out at the gray expanse of sea.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"The Suli believe that when we do wrong, we give life to our shadows. Every sin makes the shadow stronger, until eventually the shadow is stronger than you."" ""If that were true, my shadow would have put Ketterdam in permanent night."" ""Maybe,"" Inej said, turning her dark gaze to his. ""Or maybe you're someone else's shadow.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"If the privateer you've hired is entirely trustworthy, he's probably not much of a privateer.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"It’s a law of systems,” Wylan murmured. “You build in safeguards for failures, but something in the safeguards ends up causing an unforeseen failure.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"You're a blackmailer-"" ""I broker information."" ""A con artist-"" ""I create opportunity."" ""A bawd and a murderer-"" ""I don't run whores and I kill for a cause."" ""And what cause is that?"" ""Same as yours, merch. Profit.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"If you wanted to understand it, you had to take it apart and see how it worked. If you wanted to master it, you had to learn it so well you could put it back together.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"I may not walk straight,"" said Kaz. ""But at least I don't run from a fight.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"He dared a glance at Jesper now. The sharpshooter was seated at the table, hunched over his cards. He wore a battered navy waistcoat embroidered with small gold stars, and his rumpled shirt shone white against his dark brown skin.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"There's so much in the world you don't have to be afraid of, if you would only open your eyes.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"The demon closed its talons over the ribbon in her hair and tugged. It slid loose, fluttering to the floor. Slowly, it withdrew its hand. Did she imagine its regret?",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Rich men want to believe they deserve every penny they've got, so they forget what they owe to chance. Smart men are always looking for loopholes. They want an opportunity to game the system."" ""So who's the hardest mark to swindle?"" asked Nina. ""The toughest mark is an honest one,"" said Kaz. ""Thankfully, they're always in short supply.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"i want to kiss you,"" nikolai said. ""but i won't. not until you're thinking of me instead of trying to forget him.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Cautiously, she let her knuckles brush against his, a slight weight, a bird's feather. He stiffened, but he didn't pull away. ""I'm not ready to give up on this city, Kaz.

His body had stopped listening to him. He'd passed an invisible limit and simply shut down.,Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"He was stronger than this sickness, stronger than the pull of the water.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
I hope you weren't looking for me to be the voice of reason. I keep a strict diet of ill-advised enthusiasm and heartfelt regret.,Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"I thought I'd given up on Mal. I thought the love I'd had for him belonged to the past, to the foolish, lonely girl I never wanted to be again. I'd tried to bury that girl and the love she'd felt, just as I'd tried to bury my power. But I wouldn't make that mistake again. Whatever burned between us was just as bright, just as undeniable. The moment our lips met, I knew with pure and piercing certainty that I would have waited for him forever.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"I am Nikolai Lantsov, Major of the Twenty-Second Regiment, Soldier of the King’s Army, Grand Duke of Udova, and second son to His Most Royal Majesty, King Alexander the Third, Ruler of the Double Eagle Throne, may his life and reign be long.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"I can't do this,"" Genya whispered. Her face was swollen from crying. Her vibrant hair lay limp down her back. ""You don't have to do anything,"" Zoya said. ""Just be here. Stay standing."" ""Not even that."" ""I've got you. I won't let you fall.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Did you sleep?"" she asked. ""Of course not. Someday we'll see an end to war, and then you and I will take a nap together."" ""Is that your idea of seduction?"" ""These days? Yes."" ""I'll be honest- it's incredibly compelling.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Dusk had fallen. Outside the lanterns in the garden were being lit, a string of stars strewn across the grounds. She had missed this room, who Nikolai became in this room, the man who for a moment might let the mantle of king fall away, who trusted her enough to close his eyes and fall in to dreams as she stood watch. She needed to get back to the Little Palace, check on Princess Ehri, talk to Tamar, forge a plan. But this might be the last time she saw him this way. At last she rose and turned down the lights. ""Don't go,"" he said, still half asleep. ""I have to bathe. I smell like a forest fire."" ""You smell like wildflowers. You always do. What can I say to make you stay?"" His words trailed off in to a drowsy mumble as he fell back asleep. Tell me it's more than war and worry that makes you speak those words. Tell me what they would mean if you weren't a king and I weren't a soldier. But she didn't want to hear any of that, not really. Sweet words and grand declarations were for other people, other lives. She brushed the hair back from his face, planted a kiss on his forehead. ""I would stay forever if I could,"" she whispered. He wouldn't remember anyway.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"I would choose you."" The words were out before he thought better of them, and there was no way to pull them back. Silence stretched between them. Perhaps the floor will open and I'll plummet to my death, he thought hopefully. ""As your general?"" Her voice careful. She was offering him a chance to right the ship, to take them back to familiar waters. And a fine general you are. There could be no better leader. You may be prickly, but that what Ravka needs. So many easy replies. Instead he said, ""As my queen."" He couldn't read her expression. Was she pleased? Embarrassed? Angry? Every cell in his body screamed for him to crack a joke, to free both of them from the peril of the moment. But he wouldn't. He was still a privateer, and he'd come too far. ""Because I'm a dependable soldier,"" she said, but she didn't sound sure. It was the same cautious, tentative voice, the voice of someone waiting for a punch line, or maybe a blow. ""Because I know all of your secrets."" ""I do trust you more than myself sometimes- and I think very highly of myself."" Hadn't she said there was no one else she'd choose to have her back in a fight? But that isn't the whole truth, is it, you great cowardly lump. To hell with it. They might all die soon enough. They were safe here in the dark, surrounded by the hum of engines. ""I would make you my queen because I want you. I want you all the time."" She rolled on to her side, resting her head on her folded arm. A small movement, but he could feel her breath now. His heart was racing. ""As your general, I should tell you that would be a terrible decision."" He turned on to his side. They were facing each other now. ""As your king, I should tell you that no one could dissuade me. No prince and no power could make me stop wanting you."" Nikolai felt drunk. Maybe unleashing the demon had loosed something in his brain. She was going to laugh at him. She would knock him senseless and tell him he had no right. But he couldn't seem to stop. ""I would give you a crown if I could,"" he said. ""I would show you the world from the prow of a ship. I would choose you, Zoya. As my general, as my friend, as my bride. I would give you a sapphire the size of an acorn."" He reached in to his pocket. ""And all I would ask in return is that you wear this damnable ribbon in your hair on our wedding day."" She reached out, her fingers hovering over the coil of blue velvet ribbon resting in his palm. Then she pulled back her hand, cradling her fingers as if they'd been singed. ""You will wed a Taban sister who craves a crown,"" she said. ""Or a wealthy Kerch girl, or maybe a Fjerdan royal. You will have heirs and a future. I'm not the queen Ravka needs."" ""And if you're the queen I want?"" ... She sat up, drew her knees in, wrapped her arms around them as if she would make a shelter of her own body. He wanted to pull her back down beside him and press his mouth to hers. He wanted her to look at him again with possibility in her eyes. ""But that's not who I am. Whatever is inside me is sharp and gray as the thorn wood."" She rose and dusted off her kefta. ""I wasn't born to be a bride. I was made to be a weapon."" Nikolai forced himself to smile. It wasn't as if he'd offered her a real proposal. They both knew such a thing was impossible. And yet her refusal smarted just as badly as if he'd gotten on his knee and offered her his hand like some kind of besotted fool. It stung. All saints, it stung. ""Well,"" he said cheerfully, pushing up on his elbows and looking up at her with all the wry humour he could muster. ""Weapons are good to have around too. Far more useful than brides and less likely to mope about the palace. But if you won't rule Ravka by my side, what does the future hold, General?"" Zoya opened the door to the Cargo hold. Light flooded in gilding her features when she looked back at him. ""I'll fight on beside you. As your general. As your friend. Because whatever my failings, I know this. You are the king Ravka needs.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"You look absurd in that outfit."" ""Absurdly dashing, I agree.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Who enforces the laws?"" Zoya asked softly. ""Rich men. Rich men who do what they wish. Power doesn't make a man wise."" ""I'm proof enough of that."" ""You're occasionally a useless podge. But you're a good man, Nikolai, and a good king.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"The shadow of something dark moved across Kaz's face. ""If it were a trick, I'd promise you safety. I'd offer you happiness. I don't know if that exists in the Barrel, but you'll find none of it with me."" For some reason, those words had comforted her. Better terrible truths than kind lies.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Are you thinking of killing me, Zoya?"" ""Yes."" ""Your king wouldn't be pleased."" ""I'm not going to do it,"" she lied. ""I just enjoy thinking about it. It's soothing, like humming myself a little melody.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Closer, druskelle,"" she crooned, taunting. He threw an arm over her, hooking her back against his chest. She let out a startled oof and shifted uneasily. ""Stop moving,"" he muttered. He'd been close to girls- not many, it was true- but none of them had been like her. She was indecently round. ""You're cold and clammy,"" she complained with a shiver. ""It's like lying next to a burly squid."" ""You told me to get closer!"" ""Ease up a bit,"" she instructed and when he did, she flipped over to face him. ""What are you doing?"" he asked, pulling back in a panic. ""Relax, druskelle. This isn't where I have my way with you."" His blue eyes narrowed. ""I hate the way you talk.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"It's all prickles and spines and anger, covered in pretty, useless blossoms and fruit too bitter to eat. There is nothing in it worth loving."" ""How wrong you are."" Zoya's gaze snapped to his, her eyes flashing silver- dragon's eyes. ""Am I?"" ""Look at the way it grows, protecting everything within these walls, stronger than anything else in the garden, weathering every season. No matter the winter it endures, it blooms again and again."" ""What if the winter is just too long and hard? What if it can't bloom again?"" He was afraid to reach for her, but he did it anyway. He took her gloved hand in his. She didn't pull away but folded in to him like a flower closing its petals at nightfall. He wrapped his arm around her. Zoya seemed to hesitate, and then with a soft breath, she let herself lean against him. Zoya the deadly. Zoya the ferocious. The weight of her against him like a benediction. He had been strong for his country, his soldiers, his friends. It meant something different to be strong for her. ""Then you'll be branches without blossom,"" he whispered against her hair. ""And you'll let the rest of us be strong until the summer comes."" ""It wasn't a metaphor."" ""Of course it wasn't.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"Growing up means learning to go without."" ""What a depressing thought."" ""It's not so bad. Starve long enough, you forget your hunger."" He leaned closer. ""If it's so easy to lose your appetite, maybe you were never truly hungry at all.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"What they had endured on the fold had connected them in some way, and he knew he would see Zoya when he turned- yet the sight of her struck like a sudden change in the weather. A drop in temperature, the crackle of electricity in the air, the feeling of a storm coming on.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"I'm grotesque."" ""You are pink and rather hairless. Like a baby, and people love babies."" Actually, she looked more like the hairless cat his aunt Ludmilla had favoured more than any of her children, but that seemed an impolite thing to say to a lady. Ehri did not wish to be charmed. ""Must you make a joke of everything?"" ""I must. By royal mandate and the curse of my own disposition. I find life quite unbearable without laughter.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"Willows bordered the path, like women bent in mourning, their branches shod in ice and brushing the soft white ground like strands of hair.

"I would choose you."" The words were out before he thought better of them, and there was no way to pull them back. Silence stretched between them. Perhaps the floor will open and I'll plummet to my death, he thought hopefully. ""As your general?"" Her voice careful. She was offering him a chance to right the ship, to take them back to familiar waters. And a fine general you are. There could be no better leader. You may be prickly, but that's what Ravka needs. So many easy replies. Instead he said, ""As my queen."" He couldn't read her expression. Was she pleased? Embarrassed? Angry? Every cell in his body screamed for him to crack a joke, to free both of them from the peril of the moment. But he wouldn't. He was still a privateer, and he'd come too far. ""Because I'm a dependable soldier,"" she said, but she didn't sound sure. It was the same cautious, tentative voice, the voice of someone waiting for a punch line, or maybe a blow. ""Because I know all of your secrets."" ""I do trust you more than myself sometimes- and I think very highly of myself."" Hadn't she said there was no one else she'd choose to have her back in a fight? But that isn't the whole truth, is it, you great cowardly lump. To hell with it. They might all die soon enough. They were safe here in the dark, surrounded by the hum of engines. ""I would make you my queen because I want you. I want you all the time."" She rolled on to her side, resting her head on her folded arm. A small movement, but he could feel her breath now. His heart was racing. ""As your general, I should tell you that would be a terrible decision."" He turned on to his side. They were facing each other now. ""As your king, I should tell you that no one could dissuade me. No prince and no power could make me stop wanting you."" Nikolai felt drunk. Maybe unleashing the demon had loosed something in his brain. She was going to laugh at him. She would knock him senseless and tell him he had no right. But he couldn't seem to stop. ""I would give you a crown if I could,"" he said. ""I would show you the world from the prow of a ship. I would choose you, Zoya. As my general, as my friend, as my bride. I would give you a sapphire the size of an acorn."" He reached in to his pocket. ""And all I would ask in return is that you wear this damnable ribbon in your hair on our wedding day."" She reached out, her fingers hovering over the coil of blue velvet ribbon resting in his palm. Then she pulled back her hand, cradling her fingers as if they'd been singed. ""You will wed a Taban sister who craves a crown,"" she said. ""Or a wealthy Kerch girl, or maybe a Fjerdan royal. You will have heirs and a future. I'm not the queen Ravka needs."" ""And if you're the queen I want?""... She sat up, drew her knees in, wrapped her arms around them as if she would make a shelter of her own body. He wanted to pull her back down beside him and press his mouth to hers. He wanted her to look at him again with possibility in her eyes. ""But that's not who I am. Whatever is inside me is sharp and gray as the thorn wood."" She rose and dusted off her kefta. ""I wasn't born to be a bride. I was made to be a weapon."" Nikolai forced himself to smile. It wasn't as if he'd offered her a real proposal. They both knew such a thing was impossible. And yet her refusal smarted just as badly as if he'd gotten on his knee and offered her his hand like some kind of besotted fool. It stung. All saints, it stung. ""Well,"" he said cheerfully, pushing up on his elbows and looking up at her with all the wry humour he could muster. ""Weapons are good to have around too. Far more useful than brides and less likely to mope about the palace. But if you won't rule Ravka by my side, what does the future hold, General?"" Zoya opened the door to the Cargo hold.Light flooded in gilding her features when she looked back at him. ""I'll fight on beside you. As your general. As your friend. Because whatever my failings, I know this. You are the king Ravka needs.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo
"In his brief time as a student, he'd fallen in love with the Boeksplein. Jesper had never been a great reader. He loved stories, but he hated sitting still, and the books assigned to him for school seemed designed to make his mind wander. At the Boeksplein, wherever his eyes strayed, there was something to occupy them; leaded windows with stained-glass borders, iron gates worked in to figures of books and ships, the central fountain with its bearded scholar, and best of all, the gargoyles- bat-winged grotesques in mortarboard caps, and stone dragons falling asleep over books. He liked to think that whoever had built this place had known not all students were suited to quite contemplation.",Leigh Bardugo,leigh-bardugo

"He only wished that it wasn't winter. He wanted to turn his face to the sun and feel it warm him. The cold frightened him now.
