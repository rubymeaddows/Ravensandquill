The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.,Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"Certainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred's a subset of self pity and not the other way around - ' It destroys everything around it, except itself '. Self pity will destroy relationships, it'll destroy anything that's good, it will fulfill all the prophecies it makes and leave only itself. And it's so simple to imagine that one is hard done by, and that things are unfair, and that one is underappreciated, and that if only one had had a chance at this, only one had had a chance at that, things would have gone better, you would be happier if only this, that one is unlucky. All those things. And some of them may well even be true. But, to pity oneself as a result of them is to do oneself an enormous disservice. I think it's one of things we find unattractive about the american culture, a culture which I find mostly, extremely attractive, and I like americans and I love being in america. But, just occasionally there will be some example of the absolutely ravening self pity that they are capable of, and you see it in their talk shows. It's an appalling spectacle, and it's so self destructive. I almost once wanted to publish a self help book saying 'How To Be Happy by Stephen Fry : Guaranteed success'. And people buy this huge book and it's all blank pages, and the first page would just say - ' Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself - And you will be happy '. Use the rest of the book to write down your interesting thoughts and drawings, and that's what the book would be, and it would be true. And it sounds like 'Oh that's so simple', because it's not simple to stop feeling sorry for yourself, it's bloody hard. Because we do feel sorry for ourselves, it's what Genesis is all about.",Stephen Fry,Dark Academia
"How you can sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly heartless."" ""Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them."" ""I say it’s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the circumstances.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia

I drink to separate my body from my soul.,Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"The ugly and stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live-- undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They never bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Henry; my brains, such as they are-- my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks-- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia

Fashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear. Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people. And falsehoods the truths of other people. Other people are quite dreadful. The only possible society is oneself. To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance.,Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"I asked the question for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses anyone for asking any question - simple curiosity.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"Never mind what I say. I am always saying what I shouldn't say. In fact, I usually say what I really think. A great mistake nowadays. It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"Reading the very best writers—let us say Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Tolstoy—is not going to make us better citizens. Art is perfectly useless, according to the sublime Oscar Wilde, who was right about everything. He also told us that all bad poetry is sincere. Had I the power to do so, I would command that these words be engraved above every gate at every university, so that each student might ponder the splendor of the insight.",Harold Bloom,Dark Academia
"Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia

"Well, I don't like your clothes. You look perfectly ridiculous in them. Why on earth don't you go up and change? It's perfectly childish to be in mourning for a man who is actually staying a whole week with you in your house as a guest. I call it grotesque.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia

I want to paint the rest of my days with the best colors.,Debasish Mridha,Dark Academia
"So he was queer, E.M. Forster. It wasn't his middle name (that would be 'Morgan'), but it was his orientation, his romping pleasure, his half-secret, his romantic passion. In the long-suppressed novel Maurice the title character blurts out his truth, 'I'm an unspeakable of the Oscar Wilde sort.' It must have felt that way when Forster came of sexual age in the last years of the 19th century: seriously risky and dangerously blurt-able. The public cry had caught Wilde, exposed and arrested him, broken him in prison. He was one face of anxiety to Forster; his mother was another. As long as she lived (and they lived together until she died, when he was 66), he couldn't let her know.",Michael Levenson,Dark Academia
"A man's life is of more value than a woman's. It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions. Our lives revolve in curves of emotions. It is upon lines of intellect that a man's life progresses. I have just learnt this, and much else with it, from Lord Goring. And I will not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"Now, I have always wanted to agree with Lady Bracknell that there is no earthly use for the upper and lower classes unless they set each other a good example. But I shouldn't pretend that the consensus itself was any of my concern. It was absurd and slightly despicable, in the first decade of Thatcher and Reagan, to hear former and actual radicals intone piously against 'the politics of confrontation.' I suppose that, if this collection has a point, it is the desire of one individual to see the idea of confrontation kept alive.",Christopher Hitchens,Dark Academia
"It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter, who on the coloured canvas, reveals himself.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia

"When in Reading Gaol he told me that the warders in the dock had been gentle and kind, but the visit of the chaplain in his first prison began with these words: 'Mr. Wilde, did you have morning prayers in your house?'

"Poor Aubrey: I hope he will get all right. He brought a strangely new personality to English art, and was a master in his way of fantastic grace, and the charm of the unreal. His muse had moods of terrible laughter. Behind his grotesques there seemed to lurk some curious philosophy…",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
It is a consolation or a misfortune that the wrong kind of people are too often correct in their prognostications of the future; the far-seeing are also the foolish.,Robbie Ross,Dark Academia

"Donna agine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things. Your perfection is inside of you. If only you could realise that, you would not want to be rich. Ordinary riches can be stolen from a man. Real riches cannot.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"Anyone can have a pretty face, but the most beautiful things are the most fleeting. If we lived in a world of perpetual sunsets and cherry blossoms, they would become common and their colors would soon look dull. But for the evanescent moments that I exist, I am the most beautiful thing anyone has ever seen.",Kylie Lee Baker,Dark Academia

"If Sibyl is able to give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she creates a feeling of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and miserable, if she frees them from their selfishness and lends them tears for sufferings that are not their own, she deserves all your adoration, she deserves the adoration of the whole world.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia

"Yesterday I cut an orchid, for my buttonhole.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"I tought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last - such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia

"Of course I could never let you know anything about this. It would have been impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes— too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them.",The Picture of Dorian Gray,Dark Academia

"For our sake, courage has run out. Perhaps we never had it. Fear of society, which is the foundation of morality, and fear of God, which is the secret of every religion - these two fears take hold of us.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"There are sins whose enchanting charm comes more strongly from the expression of memory than from the sin itself. There are strange triumphs that appeal more to pride than to passion, triumphs that give the spirit greater pleasure than any our senses have ever given us or can ever give us.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"Human life is too short to carry the burden of other people's sins. Everyone lives their own life and pays the price for it. The only misfortune is that for one single mistake one had to pay so often. And indeed, one had to pay, and again only pay. Fate never finishes the accounts it has with a person.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia

"Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely I never tell their names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"We know not to fear death. Because even in death, there is life. Death is not the black night, but its white moon. The honeyed egg of rebirth.",Elisabeth Thomas,Dark Academia

Hearts are made to be broken.” - Oscar Wilde,Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"And it was inevitable. In every relationship with others, you have to find a way of life. With you, I had to give up either myself or you. There could be no other alternative. From a deep though misplaced affection for you; from a great pity for your defects of character and temperament; from my own proverbial good-nature and my Celtic laziness; from my artistic aversion to vulgar scenes and bad words; from that incapacity to harbour resentment of any kind, so characteristic of me in those days; from disgust at seeing existence made unhappy and ungrateful by what to me, with eyes intent on quite other things, appeared trivial trifles too to deserve more than a moment's reflection or interest: - for all these reasons, simple as they may seem, I always yielded to you.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you",N/A,Dark Academia
"To influence someone is to bestow one's soul upon them. Such a person no longer possesses his own thoughts. He is no longer consumed by his own passions. His virtues no longer belong to him. Even his sins, if they exist at all, are borrowed from someone else. He becomes an echo of another's melody, an actor in a role not written for him.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
"There are few of us who have just woken up at dawn, either after one of those sleepless nights when we almost dreamed of death, or after a night full of horrors and ghastly joys, when apparitions more terrible than reality itself haunted the chambers of our minds.",Oscar Wilde,Dark Academia
