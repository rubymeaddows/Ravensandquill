The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"Certainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred's a subset of self pity and not the other way around - ' It destroys everything around it, except itself '. Self pity will destroy relationships, it'll destroy anything that's good, it will fulfill all the prophecies it makes and leave only itself. And it's so simple to imagine that one is hard done by, and that things are unfair, and that one is underappreciated, and that if only one had had a chance at this, only one had had a chance at that, things would have gone better, you would be happier if only this, that one is unlucky. All those things. And some of them may well even be true. But, to pity oneself as a result of them is to do oneself an enormous disservice. I think it's one of things we find unattractive about the american culture, a culture which I find mostly, extremely attractive, and I like americans and I love being in america. But, just occasionally there will be some example of the absolutely ravening self pity that they are capable of, and you see it in their talk shows. It's an appalling spectacle, and it's so self destructive. I almost once wanted to publish a self help book saying 'How To Be Happy by Stephen Fry : Guaranteed success'. And people buy this huge book and it's all blank pages, and the first page would just say - ' Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself - And you will be happy '. Use the rest of the book to write down your interesting thoughts and drawings, and that's what the book would be, and it would be true. And it sounds like 'Oh that's so simple', because it's not simple to stop feeling sorry for yourself, it's bloody hard. Because we do feel sorry for ourselves, it's what Genesis is all about.",Stephen Fry,oscar-wilde
"How you can sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly heartless."" ""Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them."" ""I say it’s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the circumstances.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
A man who does not think for himself does not think at all.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde

She...can talk brillantly upon any subject provided she knows nothing about it.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
I drink to separate my body from my soul.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"The ugly and stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live-- undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They never bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Henry; my brains, such as they are-- my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks-- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
I'm a man of simple tastes. I'm always satisfied with the best.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde

because to influence a person is to give one's own soul.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
Fashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear. Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people. And falsehoods the truths of other people. Other people are quite dreadful. The only possible society is oneself. To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"I asked the question for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses anyone for asking any question - simple curiosity.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"Never mind what I say. I am always saying what I shouldn't say. In fact, I usually say what I really think. A great mistake nowadays. It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"Reading the very best writers—let us say Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Tolstoy—is not going to make us better citizens. Art is perfectly useless, according to the sublime Oscar Wilde, who was right about everything. He also told us that all bad poetry is sincere. Had I the power to do so, I would command that these words be engraved above every gate at every university, so that each student might ponder the splendor of the insight.",Harold Bloom,oscar-wilde
"Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"You look ill,” Matthew observed. “Is it my dancing? Is it me personally?” “Perhaps I’m nervous,” she said. “Lucie did say you didn’t like many people.” Matthew gave a sharp, startled laugh, before schooling his face back into a look of lazy amusement. “Did she? Lucie’s a chatterbox.” “But not a liar,” she said. “Well, fear not. I do not dislike you. I hardly know you,” said Matthew. “I do know your brother. He made my life miserable at school, and Christopher’s, and James’s.” “Alastair and I are very different,” Cordelia said. She didn’t want to say more than that. It felt disloyal to Alastair. “I like Oscar Wilde, for instance, and he does not.” The corner of Matthew’s mouth curled up. “I see you go directly for the soft underbelly, Cordelia Carstairs. Have you really read Oscar’s work?” “Just Dorian Gray,” Cordelia confessed. “It gave me nightmares.” “I should like to have a portrait in the attic,” Matthew mused, “that would show all my sins, while I stayed young and beautiful. And not only for sinning purposes—imagine being able to try out new fashions on it. I could paint the portrait’s hair blue and see how it looks.” “You don’t need a portrait. You are young and beautiful,” Cordelia pointed out. “Men are not beautiful. Men are handsome,” objected Matthew. “Thomas is handsome. You are beautiful,” said Cordelia, feeling the imp of the perverse stealing over her. Matthew was looking stubborn. “James is beautiful too,” she added. “He was a very unprepossessing child,” said Matthew. “Scowly, and he hadn’t grown into his nose.” “He’s grown into everything now,” Cordelia said. Matthew laughed, again as if he was surprised to be doing it. “That was a very shocking observation, Cordelia Carstairs. I am shocked.",Cassandra Clare,oscar-wilde
"Damn it all, MacMurrough, are you telling me you are an unspeakable of the Oscar Wilde sort?’ ‘If you mean am I Irish, the answer is yes.",Jamie O'Neill,oscar-wilde
Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.,G.K. Chesterton,oscar-wilde

"Every single human being should be the fulfilment of a prophecy: for every human being should be the realisation of some ideal, either in the mind of God or in the mind of man.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live. It is asking other people to live as one wishes to live.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"Well, I don't like your clothes. You look perfectly ridiculous in them. Why on earth don't you go up and change? It's perfectly childish to be in mourning for a man who is actually staying a whole week with you in your house as a guest. I call it grotesque.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde

"Perhaps, but Anna was right,” said Cordelia. “We must speak to more Downworlders regardless. There was much talk of Magnus Bane—” “Ah, Magnus Bane,” said Matthew. “My personal hero.” “Indeed, you once described him as ‘Oscar Wilde if he had magic powers,’ ” said James. “Magnus Bane threw a party in Spain I attended,” said Thomas. “It was a little difficult, since I did not know a soul. I got rather drunk.” Matthew lowered the flask with a grin. “Is that when you got your tattoo?” “So does that mean you’re close friends with Magnus Bane, Thomas?” said Lucie. “Can you reach out to him for help?” “He never even made an appearance at the party,” said Thomas.",Cassandra Clare,oscar-wilde
"So he was queer, E.M. Forster. It wasn't his middle name (that would be 'Morgan'), but it was his orientation, his romping pleasure, his half-secret, his romantic passion. In the long-suppressed novel Maurice the title character blurts out his truth, 'I'm an unspeakable of the Oscar Wilde sort.' It must have felt that way when Forster came of sexual age in the last years of the 19th century: seriously risky and dangerously blurt-able. The public cry had caught Wilde, exposed and arrested him, broken him in prison. He was one face of anxiety to Forster; his mother was another. As long as she lived (and they lived together until she died, when he was 66), he couldn't let her know.",Michael Levenson,oscar-wilde
"Si no podéis disfrutar leyendo un libro repetidas veces, de nada sirve leerlo ni una sola vez.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"A man's life is of more value than a woman's. It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions. Our lives revolve in curves of emotions. It is upon lines of intellect that a man's life progresses. I have just learnt this, and much else with it, from Lord Goring. And I will not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"Now, I have always wanted to agree with Lady Bracknell that there is no earthly use for the upper and lower classes unless they set each other a good example. But I shouldn't pretend that the consensus itself was any of my concern. It was absurd and slightly despicable, in the first decade of Thatcher and Reagan, to hear former and actual radicals intone piously against 'the politics of confrontation.' I suppose that, if this collection has a point, it is the desire of one individual to see the idea of confrontation kept alive.",Christopher Hitchens,oscar-wilde
"It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter, who on the coloured canvas, reveals himself.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde

He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"When in Reading Gaol he told me that the warders in the dock had been gentle and kind, but the visit of the chaplain in his first prison began with these words: 'Mr. Wilde, did you have morning prayers in your house?'

What people call insincerity is simply a method by which we can multiply our personalities.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"Poor Aubrey: I hope he will get all right. He brought a strangely new personality to English art, and was a master in his way of fantastic grace, and the charm of the unreal. His muse had moods of terrible laughter. Behind his grotesques there seemed to lurk some curious philosophy…",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
It is a consolation or a misfortune that the wrong kind of people are too often correct in their prognostications of the future; the far-seeing are also the foolish.,Robbie Ross,oscar-wilde
You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde

"Most men spontaneously live a fictitious and alien life. 'Most people are other people,' said Oscar Wilde, and he was right.",Fernando Pessoa,oscar-wilde
Those who pay their bills on time are soon forgotten. It is only by not paying one's bills that one can hope to live in the memory of the commercial classes.,Gyles Brandreth,oscar-wilde
To speak the truth is a painful thing. To be forced to tell lies is much worse.,Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"Don’t imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things. Your perfection is inside of you. If only you could realise that, you would not want to be rich. Ordinary riches can be stolen from a man. Real riches cannot.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
"Anyone can have a pretty face, but the most beautiful things are the most fleeting. If we lived in a world of perpetual sunsets and cherry blossoms, they would become common and their colors would soon look dull. But for the evanescent moments that I exist, I am the most beautiful thing anyone has ever seen.",Kylie Lee Baker,oscar-wilde
"Sometimes, people leave because things don't work, and sometimes they leave because they found someone.",Wajid Shaikh,oscar-wilde

"Si Sibyl es capaz de dar un alma a quienes han vivido sin ella, si crea un sentimiento de belleza en personas cuyas vidas han sido sórdidas y miserables, si los libera de su egoísmo y les presta lágrimas por sufrimientos que no son suyos, se merece toda tu adoración, se merece la adoración del mundo entero.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde

"I tought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last - such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde

"Can you trade options every day on Robinhood? {{What You Can Trade Each Day}}Yes — you can trade options every day [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] on Robinhood, but there are some important details to understand: How Daily Options Trading Works [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] 1. Market Hours [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] o Regular options trading hours [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] are 9:30 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. ET (U.S. stock market hours). o Robinhood also offers extended [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] hours for some options, but not all contracts are available [[1ー888ー274ー 1774]] outside normal hours. 2. Requirements [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] o You must have options [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] approval on your account. o Approval levels range from basic [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] covered calls to advanced spreads and naked options. 3. Day Trading Rules [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] o If you’re using margin and [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] make 4+ day trades in 5 business days with a margin account, you [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] may be classified as a Pattern Day Trader (PDT). o PDT status requires $25,000 minimum [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] account balance to continue day trading. 4. Risks [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] o Options are highly leveraged; [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] daily trading can magnify both gains and losses. o Be aware of expiration dates, [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] volatility, and commissions (Robinhood is commission-free, [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] but spreads and fees still apply). In short: You can trade [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] options every day on Robinhood, but you must meet account approval, follow [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] market hours, and watch out for pattern day trader rules if using margin.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde

Valuation Concerns [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] o To reach $1,000, Nvidia would need a [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] high P/E ratio, which could make it vulnerable to market [[1ー888ー274ー 1774]] corrections. 3. Economic Conditions [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] o Interest rates, inflation, [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] and tech sector volatility can affect stock prices regardless of [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] company performance. Analyst Perspectives [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] • Some analysts forecast Nvidia [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] reaching $800 $1,000+ within 2–3 years if AI growth continues. • Others caution that high valuations [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] make it risky, especially if market sentiment shifts. In short: Hitting $1,000 by 2026 is [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] possible but not guaranteed. Strong AI adoption, revenue growth [[1ー888ー274ー1774]], and market conditions would need to align, while risks from [[1ー888ー274ー1774]] competition and valuation remain.",Oscar Wilde,oscar-wilde
